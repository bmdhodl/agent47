# Contributing

Thanks for helping. This is early-stage and intentionally minimal.

## How to contribute
- Open an issue with a concrete failure case or missing feature
- Include a small reproduction if possible
- Prefer tiny PRs that add focused primitives

## Dev
```bash
cd sdk
python -m pip install -e .
```
