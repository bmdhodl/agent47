# SDK Roadmap - Now / Next / Later

SDK repo work only. Distribution-facing docs and package metadata count when
they directly strengthen coding-agent adoption.

## Recently Completed

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Eval assertion expansion | Done - `EvalSuite` now has >=12 built-in assertions |
| `estimate_cost` pricing refresh | Done - Anthropic and Google pricing refreshed on 2026-03-26; OpenAI entries retained pending direct re-verification from this environment |
| `RetryGuard` - cap retry attempts per tool | Done - configurable per-tool retry ceilings now raise `RetryLimitExceeded` |
| Offline demo | Done - `agentguard demo` proves budget, loop, and retry enforcement without API keys or network access |
| Incident reporting | Done - `agentguard incident` renders local Markdown/HTML summaries from trace files |
| Install doctor / local validation | Done - `agentguard doctor` verifies local setup, trace writing, and the next minimal integration step |
| Framework quickstart generator | Done - `agentguard quickstart --framework <stack>` prints the smallest credible starter snippet for raw, OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI |
| Savings Ledger foundation | Done - normalized usage capture and local exact-vs-estimated savings summaries now flow through SDK reports |
| Coding-agent local profile | Done - `profile=\"coding-agent\"` ships tighter loop and retry defaults for repo automation and coding agents |
| Repo-local `.agentguard.json` manifest | Done - humans and coding agents can share static local SDK defaults without dashboard coupling |
| Executable framework starters | Done - each supported stack now has a minimal runnable starter file in `examples/starters/` |
| Release stabilization for coding-agent onboarding | Done - docs, release metadata, package artifacts, and publish checks were aligned for `v1.2.4` |
| Decision query surfaces and MCP validation | Done - normalized decision extraction now works locally via `agentguard decisions`, via MCP through `get_trace_decisions`, and through repo CI/preflight coverage for the MCP server |
| Decision-trace instrumentation for human review workflows | Done - `decision.*` events, helper APIs, docs, and a local example now capture proposals, edits, approvals, and binding outcomes through the normal SDK event path |

## Now (next 2 weeks)

| Item | Success Signal |
|------|---------------|
| Coding-agent positioning and package metadata hardening | PyPI metadata, SDK README, and generated PyPI README all consistently position AgentGuard as zero-dependency runtime guardrails for coding-agent safety |
| MCP registry readiness | `mcp-server` package metadata and `server.json` are ready for official MCP registry publication without extra repo cleanup |
| Install-to-first-guard proof hardening | A fresh local flow from `pip install` to `agentguard doctor`, `agentguard demo`, `agentguard quickstart`, and a starter run works without undocumented steps or hosted assumptions |
| Coding-agent starter polish | Checked-in starter files and repo-local `.agentguard.json` guidance stay deterministic, local-first, and safe to copy into real repos without hidden network behavior |

## Next (next month)

| Item | Success Signal |
|------|---------------|
| Streaming support in patches | `patch_openai` / `patch_anthropic` capture streamed responses without losing final token and cost totals |
| Coding-agent profile v2 | Built-in coding-agent defaults cover streamed calls, fuzzy loop patterns, and stronger repo-local safety without increasing setup complexity |
| Cost model alias cleanup | Common provider aliases map cleanly onto canonical model pricing entries without warning spam |

## Later (ideas bucket)

| Item | Success Signal |
|------|---------------|
| TypeScript SDK | npm package with parity: LoopGuard, BudgetGuard, TimeoutGuard, Tracer |
| Savings Ledger heuristics / token efficiency audit | The SDK can attribute conservative exact-vs-estimated token savings beyond cache hits, loops, and retry prevention without drifting into generic prompt optimization |
| OpenTelemetry Collector sink improvements | `OtelTraceSink` supports custom resource attributes and span links without pulling the SDK toward generic observability positioning |
| `ContentGuard` - detect PII/sensitive data in agent outputs | New guard class, raises `ContentViolation`, regex-based (no deps) |
| Policy bundle import/export | Guard and sink settings can be serialized and applied across environments without a hosted control plane |

Each "Later" item stays here until it earns a "Now" or "Next" slot. Items can be deleted without ceremony.
