## Step 2: Post on Reddit (this week, 1 hr total)

Use Template 4 from outreach_templates.md. Adapt the intro for each sub.

| Subreddit | Size | Angle |
|-----------|------|-------|
| r/LangChain | ~60K | "I built this to solve the loop problem everyone keeps hitting" |
| r/LocalLLaMA | ~200K+ | "Zero deps, works with any model, MIT licensed" |
| r/AI_Agents | ~30K | "Runtime guardrails for multi-agent systems" |
| r/SideProject | ~100K | "I built a thing — agent observability SDK" |

## Step 3: Join Discords, post in #showcase (this week)

| Server | Link | Size |
|--------|------|------|
| LangChain | https://discord.gg/langchain | ~50K |
| CrewAI | https://discord.gg/crewai | ~20K |

Title: "Show HN: AgentGuard — Lightweight guardrails for AI agents (loop detection, budget limits)"

## The rule

Don't build anything new until you've talked to 5 real users.
