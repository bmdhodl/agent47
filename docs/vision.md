# Vision

## Mission
Make multi-agent systems reliable by default.

## One-line positioning
AgentGuard is a lightweight, framework-agnostic observability and evaluation SDK for multi-agent systems.

## Principles
- Be the flashlight, not the engine.
- Model-agnostic, vendor-neutral by default.
- Trace reasoning, not just latency.
- Ship useful primitives before dashboards.
- Keep the open-source core tiny and dependable.

## Non-goals
- No-code agent builders
- Full workflow runtimes
- Vertical-specific automation
