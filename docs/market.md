# Market Snapshot

## Problem
Multi-agent systems are unreliable at scale: loops, hallucinated tool calls, and nondeterministic regressions. Teams lack the equivalent of distributed tracing and test replay for reasoning chains.

## Buyers
- AI platform teams in mid-market SaaS
- Developer tool companies building agentic products
- Internal platform teams at enterprises experimenting with agents

## Why now
- Explosion of multi-agent frameworks
- Falling inference costs allow broader experimentation
- Teams are hitting reliability ceilings in production

## Alternatives
- Provider-specific eval tools (limited, vendor-locked)
- General-purpose observability (latency-focused, not reasoning-focused)

## Differentiation
- Model-agnostic traces
- Opinionated loop and cost guards
- Deterministic replay for tests
