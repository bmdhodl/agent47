# Execution Plan (Aligned to YC RFS + INTP Solo Builder)

## Goal
Ship a developer-first, self-hosted observability SDK for multi-agent systems and convert early adopters into paid dashboard pilots.

## Phase 1: Proof of Reliability (Now → 2 weeks)
- Deliver a working SDK with tracing, loop guards, and deterministic replay
- Provide one deep integration (LangChain)
- Provide a clean demo and E2E test workflow
- Capture emails via landing page

## Phase 2: Credibility + Distribution (2–6 weeks)
- Publish failure case writeups ("why agents loop")
- Release 1–2 real debugging examples with trace screenshots
- Post to Hacker News / Reddit with concrete output
- Collect feedback and 5–10 design partners

## Phase 3: Paid Pilot (6–12 weeks)
- Build a thin hosted dashboard MVP (trace viewing + retention)
- Charge first 3–5 teams for hosted access
- Iterate on reliability metrics and cost guards

## Success Criteria
- 50+ weekly OSS users
- 10+ inbound emails from builders
- 3+ paid pilots
