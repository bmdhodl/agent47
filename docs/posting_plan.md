# Posting Plan (Quick Demo Visual)

## Option A: Screenshot (fastest)
1. Run `run_demo.sh` in terminal.
2. Highlight the `AgentGuard report` output.
3. Take a screenshot and crop to just the report.

## Option B: 10-second GIF (slightly nicer)
1. Start screen recording (macOS: `Shift+Cmd+5`).
2. Run `run_demo.sh`.
3. Stop recording after the report prints.
4. Trim to 8–12 seconds.

## Caption hook
"Built a tiny observability SDK for AI agents. It traces reasoning steps, catches loops, and replays runs deterministically."
