Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router Project

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js dashboard application following best practices for App Router projects.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to project dependencies using npm
- Updated package.json with the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Modified Root Layout (src/app/layout.tsx)
- Imported `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/next`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after existing components (`{children}` and `<Toaster />`)
- Preserved all existing code structure, fonts, metadata, and styling

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component was added to the root layout file (src/app/layout.tsx) which is the appropriate location for App Router projects. This ensures that analytics tracking is enabled across all pages of the application.

The component placement follows Vercel's recommendations:
- Placed inside the `<body>` tag
- Located after the main content and other components
- Will automatically track page views and web vitals

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Successfully installed @vercel/analytics package
2. ✅ Build completed successfully (no errors)
3. ✅ Linter passed with no warnings or errors
4. ✅ No tests to run (no test scripts defined in package.json)
5. ✅ All changes properly tracked in git

## Files Modified

- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package and dependencies
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component

## Notes

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment. Vercel Web Analytics will automatically start tracking page views and web vitals once the application is deployed to Vercel. No additional configuration is required, though custom event tracking can be added later if needed.
